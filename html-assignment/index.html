            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>I am a 17-year-old Brazilian girl called Gabriela Angel. I was born in Cuiaba - <abbr
                    title="Mato Grosso">MT</abbr> but only spent two years living there before moving to the suburbs of
                Rio
                de Janeiro. I spent most of my childhood in that place, playing on the street with stray cats, going to
                ballet and gymnastic classes, and watching Michael Jackson's recorded shows every Wednesday on TV.</p>

            <p>The month before my 7<sup>th</sup> birthday, my family and I moved to Sao Paulo - <abbr
                    title="Sao Paulo">SP</abbr>, where I currently live. Through the years, my interest in
                <em>technology
                    and arts</em> increased, and by the time I finished high school, I knew I wanted to work in those
                fields. Not only that, but I also found it important to come in contact with different cultures, so I
                planned to study abroad.
            </p>
