        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a 17-year-old Brazilian girl called Gabriela Angel. I was born in Cuiaba - MT but only spent two years
            living there before moving to the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. I spent most of my childhood in that place,
            playing
            on the street with stray cats, going to ballet and gymnastic classes, and watching Michael Jackson's
            recorded
            shows every Wednesday on TV.</p>
        <p>The month before I turned 7, my family and I moved to Sao Paulo - SP, where I currently live. Through the
            years,
            my interest in technology and arts increased, and by the time I finished high school, I knew I wanted to
            work in
            those fields. Not only that, but I also found it important to come in contact with different cultures, so I
            planned to study abroad.</p>
